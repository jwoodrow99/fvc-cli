# FVC

File Version Control (FVC) is a CLI tool designed to give automated version control abilities (similar to Git) to those working with binary and media files, where traditional version control is not possible. This package is designed to increase productivity and organization, not to reduce the size of archived files similar to git.

## Future features

* Branching
  * Ability to switch between file branches (Debating weather it is necessary as a merge is not possible)

* Timeline
  * Interactive timeline describing each archive record.

* Heat map
  * GitHub style heat map, showing how often you make saves.

## Updating

* Simply go to the folder where you cloned the repo initially and run the following commands.

    ```bash
    git pull
    npm install
    ```

## How to set up

### Required Software

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

1. Clone the repo (Preferably run commands in Git Bash on Windows or Terminal on MacOS \ Linux)

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/jwoodrow99/fvc.git
    cd fvc
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Like application to CLI

    ```bash
    npm link

    fvc
    ```

## Windows Command not found Issue ([More Info](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27864040/fixing-npm-path-in-windows-8-and-10))

This is a common issue with Node and NPM (not FVC). We need to update the path variable to include the Node and NPM binary files so they are globally accessable.

1. Use the global Search to search "Environment Variables"

2. Click "Edit system environment variables"

3. Click "New"

4. Add NPM path ```C:\Users\{yourName}\AppData\Roaming\npm```
